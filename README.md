## ðŸ›  How to use

For browsers, download the zip file and you simply use the script tag to load bundled file.
```html
<script src="./danfebooks.pit.js"></script>
```
This script tag will expose a variable called "`danfebooks`" to your global space. 

For nodejs, install the package
```
npm i -S @danfebooks/nepalpit
```

And then, require the package

```js
// app.js
var danfebooks = require('@danfebooks/nepalpit');
```

You can read about **options** and **APIs** on the "Guides (in progress)" page. Please check the [example](./example) directory for code samples.
